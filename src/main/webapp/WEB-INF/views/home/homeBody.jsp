	<p>This is suppose to be my demo environment. I’ve always liked to play around different web techniques so I set-up little playground for myself</p>
	
	<p>At the moment I’m interested about <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring framework</a> and possibilities it brings to web development.
	There minor examples about usage of <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/">Spring MVC</a> and <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/relational-data-access/">JDBC with Spring</a></p>
	
	<p>I’ve also play around little bit <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/">Google Web Toolkit</a> but those examples are included later</p>
	
	<p>These pages are using HTML5, CSS3 and JQuery. There’s also usage of <a href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables.net</a> with table decorator</p>
